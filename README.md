# Audio Steganography

A concept of audio steganography accelerated with FPGA.

  - High speed data computing
  - Hard to detect

## How it works?
For easier implementation on FPGA board the main algoritm is simply, but effective LSB coding.
One bit of data is coded on almost every sample in audio file. Quality of sound remains good.
